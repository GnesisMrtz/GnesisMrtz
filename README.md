<h2>✨Welcome to my github✨</h2>

<p> I recently got into coding after my good friend Tanya (<b>tanyaleepr</b> here in Github) persuaded me into join her in
  her journey. Right now, I'm obssessed with Web Development even though I am still learning about it (I am a newbie)
  Even with all the headache that learning CSS has brought me, I am loving all of this and I am excited to share my projects
with all of you!</p>
